### Framework Awareness

Claude recognizes these framework features:
- `DEVTB_Loop` - Advanced loop implementation
- `devtb_component()` - Bootstrap component renderer
- `devtb_ajax()` - AJAX handler registration
- `devtb_api_route()` - REST API endpoints
- Framework file structure

---

## Effective Prompting

### The Perfect Prompt Formula

```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge, [action] [what] with [features] using [Bootstrap components]"
```

### Examples of Good Prompts

✅ **Specific and Clear:**
```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge, create a Products custom post type 
with price, SKU, and gallery fields. Display in a Bootstrap card grid 
with filtering by category and AJAX load more button."
```

✅ **References Framework Features:**
```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge's DEVTB_Loop, create a featured posts 
section showing 3 posts with thumbnails in Bootstrap cards, ordered by 
a custom 'priority' meta field."
```

✅ **Includes Technical Details:**
```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge, add an AJAX contact form with nonce 
verification, honeypot field, and email validation. Show success/error 
messages using Bootstrap alerts."
```

### Examples of Poor Prompts

❌ **Too Vague:**
```
"Make a website"
```

❌ **Missing Context:**
```
"Add a slider" (Doesn't mention the framework)
```

❌ **Unrealistic:**
```
"Create a complete e-commerce site like Amazon"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Step Development

Break complex features into steps:

**Step 1:** Create the foundation
```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge, create an Events custom post type 
with date, time, and location fields."
```

**Step 2:** Add functionality
```
"Add a calendar view for the Events using Bootstrap components 
with month/week/day views."
```

**Step 3:** Enhance with features
```
"Add AJAX filtering for Events by category and date range 
with loading animations."
```

### Component Composition

Combine multiple components:

```
"Using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge, create a hero section combining:
- Bootstrap carousel for backgrounds
- Overlay with heading and text
- Call-to-action buttons
- Responsive for all devices"
```

### Plugin Conversion

Convert features to plugins:

```
"Convert the Events feature we created into a standalone WordPress 
plugin that works with any theme, maintaining Bootstrap compatibility."
```

1. User registration system using DevelopmentTranslation Bridge"

Then:
"2. Add member dashboard with Bootstrap components"

Then:
"3. Create content restriction system"
```

### Performance Optimization

Request optimizations explicitly:

```
"Optimize the Events listing for performance:
- Implement query caching
- Add lazy loading for images
- Paginate results
- Minimize database queries"
```

### Accessibility

Ensure accessibility:
